 we're going to fefactor an Augment AI prompt 'Q:\_kyle\temp_documents\GitHub\PowerShellScripts\bookmarks\ai-prompts\auggie-bookmark-prompt.md' that will generate a Powershell script 'Q:\_kyle\temp_documents\GitHub\PowerShellScripts\bookmarks\bookmarks.ps1' that will add a series of Internet shortcuts to bookmarks of the web browsers of the local host.

 the shortcuts will be in the folder called """myTech.Today""",  with appropriate subfolders as needed.   this """myTech.Today""" bookmark folder will be the first  bookmark folder in the bookmark folder list  and it will also be the first bookmark on the bookmark bar.

 The subfolders will be in the same category as the application categories of 'Q:\_kyle\temp_documents\GitHub\PowerShellScripts\app_installer\install-gui.ps1' and 'Q:\_kyle\temp_documents\GitHub\PowerShellScripts\app_installer\install.ps1'.  These links will be helpful links for each category of user that they would definitely find useful, and other that might surprise them with their use-journey.  There will be another """myTech.Today""" subfolder (so, myTech.Today/myTech.Today/) will contain links to information about the local host, such as BelArc Advisor's system reports, or any other links, such as to log files, reports, etc on the local host (in the %USERPROFILE%\myTech.Today\logs\, ....\Reports, etc files).  So that the log files can be viewed in the Browser, etc.



The script, with the proper cmd line call will also remove all of these links from all of the installed broswers.



The script will make a backup of the bookmarks before doing any changes to the bookmarks and shortcuts,
